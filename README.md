* Anthropic was founded as a result of directional differences between Anthropics founders (Dario and Daniel Amodei) and OpenAI leadership.   

Anthropic provides a very clear mission statiement [^2]:

>Anthropic exists for our mission: to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish. Progress this decade may be rapid, and we expect increasingly capable systems to pose novel challenges. We pursue our mission by building frontier systems, studying their behaviors, working to responsibly deploy them, and regularly sharing our safety insights. We collaborate with other projects and stakeholders seeking a similar outcome.

In recent interviews with [AI Businesss](https://aibusiness.com/verticals/eleven-openai-employees-break-off-to-establish-anthropic-raise-124m) regarding the startup Dario Amodei stated [^3]:

>“Anthropic’s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,” 

### Anthropic Funding

Anthropic funding comes from a variety of sources including investment firms and large organizations such as AWS and Google.  Over the last year the company has secured over $7.3 billion in funding.  With the commitments of companies such as AWS and Google the funding does come with stipulations as part of the partnership including the commitment by Anthropic to utilize assets such as cloud computing resources and chips by the funding entities.

The following companies and firms have publicly invested in Anthropic:

1. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) completed a $4 billion investment in Anthropic as of March 2024.  The partnership involves Anthropics's use of Amazon's chips to build it's AI software and Amazon has added Anthropic to its cloud services. [^4]
2. [Google](www.google.com) has invested $2+ billion over multiple years in Anthropic [^5]
3. [Menlo Ventures](https://menlovc.com/) completed a $750 million funding for Anthropic in 2023 [^6]

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
We believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
https://www.anthropic.com/customers

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Anthropic's goal is to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. One of their AI systems, Claude, is a group of models that includes Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Claude is multimodal, meaning it can process more than text inputs, and can also process multiple images in one request. Claude 3 Opus, a newer version of Claude, has outperformed other leading chatbots on benchmark tests and is particularly useful for analyzing scientific data, generating computer code, and solving mathematical problems. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Anthropic, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup, uses a variety of technologies to develop and train its AI systems:
AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips
These low-cost, high-performance compute chips are used to develop and train Anthropic's foundation models.
Google Kubernetes Engine
This technology is used to run inference for Anthropic's AI system, Claude.
Google TPU v5e chips
These chips are used to train Anthropic's generative AI models.
Dictionary learning
This compute-intensive technique is used to identify patterns of neural activations, or features, in generative pretrained transformers. For example, Anthropic used dictionary learning to identify millions of features in Claude, including one associated with the Golden Gate Bridge.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
