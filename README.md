>Anthropic exists for our mission: to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish. Progress this decade may be rapid, and we expect increasingly capable systems to pose novel challenges. We pursue our mission by building frontier systems, studying their behaviors, working to responsibly deploy them, and regularly sharing our safety insights. We collaborate with other projects and stakeholders seeking a similar outcome.

In recent interviews with [AI Businesss](https://aibusiness.com/verticals/eleven-openai-employees-break-off-to-establish-anthropic-raise-124m) regarding the startup Dario Amodei stated [^3]:

>“Anthropic’s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,” 

### Anthropic Funding

Anthropic funding comes from a variety of sources including investment firms and large organizations such as AWS and Google.  Over the last year the company has secured over $7.3 billion in funding.

## Business Activities

### What problem is Anthropic established to solve?

Anthropic's stated mission is to ensure that AI benefits people and society as a whole.  The company isn't attempting to solve a specific AI problem or business problem, but rather identify how we can responsibly advance and adopt AI for the overall benefit of society.

Anthropic was set up by its founders as a [public-benefit company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation) in support of its mission.  This differentiates the company from its competetitors.  While the intent is to be a profitable venture, the public-benefit designation allows Anthropic to act in the benefit for the company versus the benefit of the investors and shareholders.  Establishing this type of corporate entity allows Anthropic to meet its goal of having a positive societal impact with AI over share holder profits while still maintaining a viable company.

Anthropic is attempting to solve ethics, safety and research issues within AI as an industry rather than a specific business problem.  This further pushes the industry and challenges traditional C corporations. 

### Who are Anthropic's customers?

With some exceptions (such as code suggestions) Anthropic is not providing business specific AI offerings.  Rather the company is providing a set of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a foundational platform that businesses can utilize to develop AI solutions to their own unique needs.  This allows Anthropic to have a wide variety of customers across industries including (Not comprehensive) [^7]:

1. GitLab (Technology)
2. Steno (Legal Services)
3. Gamma (Presentation/Asset Creation Services)
4. Jumpcut (FIlm Industry)
5. Asana (Software Services)
6. Bridgewater (Investment Services)
7. LexisNexis (Legal Services)
8. Lonely Planet (Travel services)
9. Slack (Communication & Collaboration Services)

Anthropic further serves their customer base through partnership and alliances with services providers such as Amazon Web Services and implementation/consulting partners like [Accenture](www.accenture.com) and [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/) for customer support.

Anthropic's goal is to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. One of their AI systems, Claude, is a group of models that includes Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Claude is multimodal, meaning it can process more than text inputs, and can also process multiple images in one request. Claude 3 Opus, a newer version of Claude, has outperformed other leading chatbots on benchmark tests and is particularly useful for analyzing scientific data, generating computer code, and solving mathematical problems. 

### Anthropic Technologies

Anthropic provides a foundational AI capability called Claude capable of advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation and multilingual processing.  Claude allows for sub system use designed for functional vs. cost based needs for customers, including [^8]

1. Claude - Haiku:  A fast low cost model for lightweight workloads
2. Claude - Sonnet: Balances cost, efficiency and speed for high throughput tasks
3. Claude - Opus: Model handling complex analysis and higher order math and coding add a greater price point. 

Anthropic uses a variety of technologies in building their offerings to customers.  Many technologies are established as part of investment terms as previously mentioned in the funding analysis.  Some of these include:

1. AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips utilized to develop and train models.
2. Google Kubernetes Engine to run inference for Claude
3. Google TPU v5e chips to train generative AI models
