# SMU AI Bootcamp Case Study

## Overview and Origin for Anthropic

* The following AI case study outlines Anthropic

### Anthropic founding and mission statements


* Anthropic was founded and incorporated in
2021

* Anthropic was founded by several former OpenAI executives and employees with notable members including [^1]:
1. Dario Amodei - Co-founder and CEO
2. Daniela Amodei - Co-Founder and President 
3. Jason Clinton - CISO
4. Jared Kaplan - Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer
5. Ben Mann - Co-Founder, Technical Staff
6. Jack Clark - Co-Founder, Head of Policy
7. Mike Krieger - Chief Product Office
8. Jan Leike - former OpenAI alignment researcher


* Anthropic's current Board of Directors includes:
1. Dario Amodei
2. Daniela Amodei
3. Luke Muehlhauser
4. Yasmin Razavi

* Anthropic was founded as a result of directional differences between Anthropics founders (Dario and Daniel Amodei) and OpenAI leadership.   

Anthropic provides a very clear mission statiement [^2]:

>Anthropic exists for our mission: to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish. Progress this decade may be rapid, and we expect increasingly capable systems to pose novel challenges. We pursue our mission by building frontier systems, studying their behaviors, working to responsibly deploy them, and regularly sharing our safety insights. We collaborate with other projects and stakeholders seeking a similar outcome.

In recent interviews with [AI Businesss](https://aibusiness.com/verticals/eleven-openai-employees-break-off-to-establish-anthropic-raise-124m) regarding the startup Dario Amodei stated [^3]:

>“Anthropic’s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,”

As of February 2024, the artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic had raised $7.3 billion in funding over the previous year. Some of the notable funding deals include:
Amazon
In March 2024, Amazon Web Services (AWS) completed its $4 billion investment in Anthropic. This was the second tranche of funding after an initial $1.25 billion investment in September 2023. As part of the collaboration, Anthropic uses Amazon's custom chips to build and deploy AI software, and Amazon has added Anthropic's technology to its cloud business offerings.
Google
Google has invested multiple times in Anthropic, including $450 million in 2024, $300 million in late 2023, and up to $2 billion in October 2023. The $2 billion investment included a $500 million upfront cash infusion and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time.
Menlo Ventures
Menlo Ventures led a $750 million funding round for Anthropic in April and May 2023

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
We believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
https://www.anthropic.com/customers

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Anthropic's goal is to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. One of their AI systems, Claude, is a group of models that includes Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Claude is multimodal, meaning it can process more than text inputs, and can also process multiple images in one request. Claude 3 Opus, a newer version of Claude, has outperformed other leading chatbots on benchmark tests and is particularly useful for analyzing scientific data, generating computer code, and solving mathematical problems. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Anthropic, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup, uses a variety of technologies to develop and train its AI systems:
AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips
These low-cost, high-performance compute chips are used to develop and train Anthropic's foundation models.
Google Kubernetes Engine
This technology is used to run inference for Anthropic's AI system, Claude.
Google TPU v5e chips
These chips are used to train Anthropic's generative AI models.
Dictionary learning
This compute-intensive technique is used to identify patterns of neural activations, or features, in generative pretrained transformers. For example, Anthropic used dictionary learning to identify millions of features in Claude, including one associated with the Golden Gate Bridge.
